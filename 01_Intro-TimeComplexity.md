An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. It’s a well-defined, finite sequence of instructions that, when followed, accomplish a particular task or solve a specific problem. Algorithms are fundamental to computer science, and they serve as the blueprint for creating programs and applications. They can be as simple as sorting a list of numbers or as complex as building an artificial intelligence system.

For example, one common algorithm is the **bubble sort**, which is used to sort an array of numbers in ascending or descending order.

### Time Complexity

**Time complexity** refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. It is used to estimate the efficiency of an algorithm, particularly how the execution time increases as the input size grows. Time complexity is often expressed in **Big O notation**, which helps to describe the upper bound of the runtime, focusing on how the algorithm behaves for large inputs.

Here are some common Big O notations and their meanings:

1. **O(1)** – Constant time: The algorithm's execution time doesn’t change with the size of the input. An example is accessing an element in an array by its index.
   
2. **O(log n)** – Logarithmic time: The algorithm’s time grows logarithmically with the input size. An example is **binary search** in a sorted list.

3. **O(n)** – Linear time: The algorithm’s time grows linearly with the input size. For example, a simple loop that iterates through each element in an array has O(n) time complexity.

4. **O(n log n)** – Linearithmic time: This is common for more efficient sorting algorithms like **merge sort** and **quick sort**.

5. **O(n²)** – Quadratic time: The time grows quadratically with the input size. An example is the **bubble sort** algorithm, which compares every pair of elements.

6. **O(2^n)** – Exponential time: The execution time doubles with each additional input element. This is typical of brute-force algorithms that explore all possibilities, such as some recursive solutions to problems like the **traveling salesman**.

### Why Time Complexity Matters

Time complexity helps us analyze how well an algorithm scales. In practical terms, algorithms with better time complexity can handle larger datasets and perform faster. When designing software or solving problems, understanding the time complexity helps developers choose the right algorithms based on performance requirements.
